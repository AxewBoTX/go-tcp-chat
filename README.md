# Golang CLI Chat App

Simple TCP chat app implementation in golang.<br/>
I used the basic [standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std) provided by golang in order to make this project, and I also used [fatih/color](https://github.com/fatih/color) for displaying colors in the CLI.

This project uses simple json **encoding** and **decoding** in order to transfer data over the network.

You can refer to following links in order to learn more about this project.
